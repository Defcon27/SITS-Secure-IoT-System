        Lightweight cryptography performs strong security mechanism, encryption or decryption with low power applications and other functionalities for the pervasive computing. Here we apply the lightweight symmetry key algorithm in order to achieve end-to-end security and with lower power consumption in these devices. These lightweight algorithms are designed for IoT to deal with the security and resource utilization challenges. This is done by implementing various encryption and security algorithms so that the data being transferred between these IoT devices is very secure and is not vulnerable to breaches. The main focus of this paper is to implement these algorithms into one shared platform for all IoT devices from secure authentication to data encryption.
